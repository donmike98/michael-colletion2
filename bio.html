                <h4>Inspiration behind the collection</h4> My inspiration behind collecting images of recent burger's I have ate started when I was 17 years old. It all began with a simple snapchat, then everytime I went to a resturant I started to save the pitures of the meal. This lead to my
                small collection building over the months. I wanted to keep my collection of images for further comparison from different well-known restuarants.

                    The Diner.</p>

                <h4>The future for my collection</h4>

                <p>In hope of creating this collection, I want to inspire others to take photos of there meal as I want them to see the craft behind making a burger and it's complexity. I would also like others to send there images and added into my collection.</p>
