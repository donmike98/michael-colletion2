                My name is Michael if you didn't already know and I'm car enthusiast. In my spare time I attends car shows. Also, I'm big on the football team chealsea. I went to my first game when I was 9 years old and has supported them ever since. Naturally growing
                up in the area I live in football is picked up as the main way to pass free time. As a child the closest to driving a car was through go-karting, this was really fun and I would spend hours with mates going through all the different tracks

                <p>I have always had a competitive side to me aswell due to the hobbies I take part in my spare time. The other side to me is I also like to complete puzzles, crosswords and soduko as I believe these activities help to keep the brain active
                    as well as give me good alone time.</p>

                <p>The real Michael is a determined student in year one who is trying to get an honours degree in computer systems engineering. Friends and family members play a bit part of my life and hate the fact of being alone. I'm always trying to be
                    positive and carry out helpful actions for the people around me.</p>
